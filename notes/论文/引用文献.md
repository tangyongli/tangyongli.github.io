# SAR data的缺点
>Mapping tobacco planting areas in smallholder farmlands using Phenological-Spatial-Temporal LSTM from time-series Sentinel-1 SAR images
>>Moreover, ==SAR signals may be affected by environmental factors like terrain== and climate conditions. Optimizing the processing of time series SAR data may also improve the derivation of phenological information\
