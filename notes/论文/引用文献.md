>Traditional CNNs mainly designed for RGB images typically use 2-D convolution kernels in convolution layers to glide convolution in space dimension. However, ==the hidden spectral information of crops from multispectral images might be ignored by 2-D CNN==. 3-D CNN architecture used in this module can simultaneously process the spatial and spectral features with 3-D convolutions giving better investments of the few samples available with fewer trainable parameter
