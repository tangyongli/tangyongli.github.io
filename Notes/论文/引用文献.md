We provide empirical evidence that the ==temporal structure of Sentinel-2 data is richer==than the spatial structure for crop type classification, and, consequently, that most of a model’s complexity should be allocated to it.

# why using 3dcnn
>Traditional CNNs mainly designed for RGB images typically use 2-D convolution kernels in convolution layers to glide convolution in space dimension. However, ==the hidden spectral information of crops from multispectral images might be ignored by 2-D CNN==. 3-D CNN architecture used in this module can simultaneously process the spatial and spectral features with 3-D convolutions giving better investments of the few samples available with fewer trainable parameter
