## 消融学习-评价指标提升轻微，但目视效果更好
The addition of PLR leads to only marginal improvements in overall performance, but the improvement in local details is noticeable. Fig. 7 shows the visual changes brought about by PLR. We observe that narrow roads, small crops, and thin rivers are recognized more accurately.
