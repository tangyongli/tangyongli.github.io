 2024-IJAEO-Time-series simulation of alpine grassland cover using transferable stacking deep learning and multisource remote sensing data in the Google Earth Engine
 ==The recursive feature elimination (RFE) with a cross-validation algorithm== is used for feature selection, with automatically evaluates the impact of each feature on modeling accuracy using the mean square error as an evaluation metric and gradually remove fewer contributing features (Lou et al., 2023a). Through this process, the dimensionality of the multisource driving dataset is reduced, and the model's generalization ability is enhanced, reducing the risk of overfitting
