From 22,000 Miles Up, A New Sensor Can Track Air Pollution to Its Source
fill in the gaps in ground-based monitoring networks
track most major air pollutants during daylight hours
how air quality changes ==hour by hour==
What, exactly, is ==in the air== we’re breathing
in rural areas
in the global south
In state

==it can identify disparities in cities==, showing that higher fossil fuel emissions occur in low-income and nonwhite communities.
A lot of pollution can be transported from the source region a long distance, affecting the chemistry and pollution somewhere else

On one hot July day
improvements ==in US air quality== started to plateau
==Ongoing advances== in artificial intelligence could extend the data even further
With respect to air quality and greenhouse gas measurements,” Liu said. “I think we’re actually in a prime-time period.
