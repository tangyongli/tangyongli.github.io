Legacy GIS[遗留GIS系统，类似桌面GIS] often faces limitations in handling different data types, sizes, and velocities, ==hindering== adaptability to diverse data sources
Traditional GIS required significant investment in onpremises infrastructure, making it cost-prohibitive for many organizations
Additionally, the rapid adoption of data and analysis for decision making by organizations of all sectors and sizes has increased the need for easily automated, connected, and repeatable workflows ==running on top of large scale data== that are better supported by the modern data stack.
organizations are now ==favoring== openness, favoring more widely adopted mechanisms like Python and Spatial SQL ==over== proprietary tools and languages
making it particularly useful for spatial visualization.
